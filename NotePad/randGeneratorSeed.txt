Type a statement using srand() to seed random number generation using variable seedVal. Then type two statements using rand() to print two random integers between (and including) 0 and 9. End with a newline. Ex:
5
7
Note: For this activity, using one statement may yield different output (due to the compiler calling rand() in a different order). Use two statements for this activity. Also, after calling srand() once, do not call srand() again

------------

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>   // Enables use of rand()
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int seedVal;

   cin >> seedVal;

   /* Your solution goes here  */
   srand(seedVal);
   cout << rand() % 10 << endl;
   cout << rand() % 10 << endl;

   return 0;
}

-------------

Generate a random integer between -6 and 7 (inclusive)
(rand() % 14) + -6;

he divisor is the range size, so 7 - -6 + 1 = 14, which yields 0 to 13. That range is shifted by -6 to yield -6 to 7. 

_NEXT_

Generate a random integer between 6 and 25 (inclusive)
(rand() % 20) + 6;

The divisor is the range size, so 25 - 6 + 1 = 20, which yields 0 to 19. That range is shifted by 6 to yield 6 to 25. 

-------------
Type two statements that use rand() to print 2 random integers between (and including) 100 and 149. End with a newline. Ex:
101
133
Note: For this activity, using one statement may yield different output (due to the compiler calling rand() in a different order). Use two statements for this activity. Also, srand() has already been called; do not call srand() again.

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>   // Enables use of rand()
#include <ctime>     // Enables use of time()
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int seedVal;

   cin >> seedVal;
   srand(seedVal);

   /* Your solution goes here  */
   cout << (rand() % 50) + 100 << endl;
   cout << (rand() % 50) + 100 << endl;

   return 0;
}
